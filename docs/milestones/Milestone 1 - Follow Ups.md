3. [x] In Platform Admin Dashboard - Campaign Reviews, approved campaigns should not show up. The tag showing "1 Connected Campaigns" should be removed too.
4. [x] fetchAllUserCells is available for Pending Submissions

## ⚠️ Deferred Issues & New Todo Items

The following issues are deferred as they are not critical features at the moment but they will be registered as trackable issues.

### 1. Approve Completion - Status Check Commented Out

- **File**: `/contracts/contracts/ckboost-campaign-type/src/recipes.rs`
- **Content**:

```rust
// TODO: Not handling this for now
// // Verify campaign status is active (4)
// if input_campaign_data.status() != 4u8.into() {
//     debug!("Campaign is not active, status: {}", input_campaign_data.status());
//     return Err(DeterministicError::BusinessRuleViolation);
// }
```

- **Issue**: Campaign status validation is disabled, allowing approval at any status.
- **Status**: Deferred as only necessary for marginal cases.

### 2. Protocol Type - Timestamp

- **File**: `/contracts/contracts/ckboost-protocol-type/src/recipes.rs`
- **Content**:

```rust
// TODO: Implement proper timestamp retrieval from header deps
// TODO: Check expiration when we have proper timestamp access
```

- **Issue**: Protocol timestamp is accurate and validated
- **Status**: Deferred as only needed in tipping proposal and it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 3. SSRI Server Error Reporting

- **File**: Multiple service files in `/dapp/lib/services/`
- **Issue**: When SSRI server is not ready, errors are generic.
- **Status**: Deferred as implementations of executor is not confirmed yet and it shouldn't be sensible to generic users.

### 4. Re-funding after approval of campaign

- **Issue**: After approval of campaign, the re-funding interface is not available yet.
- **Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 5. Store Campaign cover with Nostr

- **Issue**: Campaign cover should be stored on Nostr
- **Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 6. Rewards stats for campaign detail page

- **Issue**: It's getting the available rewards but not the distributed rewards.
- **Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 7. Endorser info for campaigns

- **Issue**: Endorser info is not showing up for campaigns.
- **Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 8. Campaign Rules are descriptive

- **Issue**: Campaign Rules are only descriptive. Should work together with automatic submission approval.
- **Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.
