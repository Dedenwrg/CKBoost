# CKBoost Milestone 1 Testing Guideline

## Preface

As we are still in the development phase, the testing guideline is subject to change as we progress. Considering the size of the project, please check carefully if you're testing features that are in the scope of M1. There are also deferred issues and new todo items in the [Follow Ups](./Milestone 1 - Follow Ups.md) document, so please check them out too before further testing or reporting.

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing guidelines for CKBoost Milestone 1 release. The testing covers three main user roles: Platform Admin, Campaign Admin, and Regular User. All bugs and feedback should be reported as GitHub issues in the [CKBoost repository](https://github.com/Alive24/CKBoost/issues).

## Testing Environment

### Prerequisites

1. **CKB Testnet Wallet**: Install a CKB-CCC compatible in-browser wallet (UTXOGlobal is recommended while JoyID is not yet supported brought by some compatibility issues; tests have not been done with the rest of the supported wallets while reports are welcomed).
2. **Test CKB**: Obtain testnet CKB from the faucet
3. **Browser**: Tested on Chrome and Brave;
4. **Test UDT Tokens**: Shall share the test tokens with Stable++ which is available publicly at [https://testnet0815.stablepp.xyz/](https://testnet0815.stablepp.xyz/)

### Access URLs
> Note: Links to each of them will be available based on your roles under the global wallet connector.
- **Main Application**: https://ckboost.netlify.app/
- **Platform Admin**: `/platform-admin`
- **Campaign Admin**: `/campaign-admin`
- **User Dashboard**: `/campaigns`

### Test Accounts

Any account can test as regular user while testing as platform admin and campaign admin shall be done after invitation and onchain authorization. Contact by creating issue or commenting here if you would like to try access too.
